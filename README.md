- 👋 Hi, I’m @jasonbeecher
- 👀 I’m interested in golang, python, linux, cloud services, and building tools, libraries and APIs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS, Docker, some full-stack development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building tools, libraries, and APIs, maybe some front-end projects too
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll update my email next year (I don't spend much time on social media)
- 🐔 My current projects:
  - 🥚 some private golang repos for learning and experimentation
  - 🥚 refreshing my scripting skills (python and shell)
  - 🥚 updating my front-end knowledge
  - 🥚 revisiting online advertising APIs (a professional interest)
